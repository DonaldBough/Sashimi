# Sashimi
When tracking calories at home, it's pretty tough to convert the grams, cups, and whatever else to add everything together. On top of that, there's a little mental math to figure out the calories for the portion you actually ate.

That's why Sashimi was made! A simple web app calculator, it lets you add different units together and find how many calories you ate.
